⚠️ **Campaign products require pledges of intent to use from public sector organisations before development proceeds.**

This catalogue shows innovative products currently in the campaign phase - seeking collective interest from government bodies before full development. These solutions address specific public sector challenges and require a minimum number of organisations to pledge they would use the product if developed, to ensure viability and real demand.

Campaign products offer:

- **Tailored solutions** - built specifically for UK public sector needs
- **Early adopter benefits** - influence product direction and get priority access
- **Risk mitigation** - proven demand before full development investment

**How it works**: Express your organisation's interest and intent to use during the campaign phase. Once the minimum number of pledges is reached, development begins with participating organisations as founding users.
