Figma for Government is a secure, collaborative design platform specifically built for UK public sector organizations to modernize how they conceptualize, design, and deliver digital services for citizens. With ISO 27001 certification and Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation, it provides government teams with the tools to create better citizen experiences while maintaining the highest security standards required for public sector work.

Traditional government design processes often involve disconnected tools, lengthy approval cycles, and limited collaboration between stakeholders. Figma for Government transforms this by providing a unified platform where policy experts, designers, developers, and citizen representatives can work together in real-time to create inclusive, accessible digital services that meet GOV.UK Design System standards.

Transform your department's digital service delivery with Figma for Government:

1. **Secure Setup**: Deploy across your organization with SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, and network access controls
2. **Collaborative Design**: Bring together multidisciplinary teams to co-create citizen-centered solutions
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Test ideas quickly with interactive prototypes before development
4. **Inclusive Feedback**: Gather input from citizens and stakeholders throughout the design process
5. **Design System Integration**: Maintain consistency with GOV.UK Design System components
6. **Secure Handoff**: Provide developers with specifications and assets through secure channels

Figma for Government supports the full spectrum of public sector digital transformation:

- **Service Designers** can map citizen journeys, identify pain points, and prototype solutions that address real user needs while maintaining accessibility standards.

- **Policy Teams** can visualize complex regulations and processes, making them more understandable for both citizens and staff implementing them.

- **IT Departments** gain enterprise-grade security controls, audit trails, and integration capabilities that meet stringent government requirements.

### Accelerate citizen-centered service delivery

Figma for Government enables UK public sector organizations to move from idea to deployed service faster than ever before. By providing a collaborative environment where stakeholders can see, interact with, and refine designs in real-time, departments can reduce design-to-deployment cycles by up to 60% while ensuring solutions truly meet citizen needs through continuous feedback and iteration.

### Maintain security without compromising collaboration

Built on an enterprise-grade, isolated environment specifically for government use, Figma for Government provides the security controls required for sensitive public sector work while enabling the open collaboration necessary for innovative service design. With granular access controls, audit logging, and data residency options, departments can maintain compliance while breaking down silos.

### Integrate with existing government workflows

Figma for Government connects seamlessly with existing public sector tools and processes through APIs, single sign-on integration, and workflow automation. Rather than disrupting established procedures, it enhances them by providing a central hub for design collaboration that works alongside procurement systems, development workflows, and citizen engagement platforms.

## Business Needs

### Citizen Journey Mapping

Create comprehensive visualizations of citizen interactions with government services, identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement across departments. Local authorities like those implementing GOV.UK Verify have used collaborative design tools to map complex multi-agency citizen journeys and identify streamlining opportunities.

### Inclusive Service Design

Engage diverse stakeholders including citizens with disabilities, elderly users, and those with limited digital literacy in the design process through accessible prototyping and feedback collection. Ensure all government services meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards from the design phase onward.

### Cross-Department Collaboration

Break down traditional silos by enabling real-time collaboration between policy teams, service designers, developers, and citizen representatives. Create shared understanding of complex government processes and ensure consistent citizen experiences across touchpoints.

### Rapid Response Capability

Quickly design and prototype emergency services, crisis response portals, or urgent policy implementation tools. During COVID-19, government teams needed to rapidly deploy new digital services - Figma for Government enables this agility while maintaining security and accessibility standards.

### Design System Implementation

Maintain consistency across all government digital services by implementing and evolving design systems that ensure brand coherence, accessibility compliance, and user experience consistency. Support the GOV.UK Design System while allowing for department-specific customizations.

### Evidence-Based Design Decisions

Document design rationale, user research findings, and iteration history to support evidence-based decision making and demonstrate value to stakeholders. Create audit trails that support transparency requirements while protecting sensitive design processes.

### Procurement and Vendor Management

Streamline design handoffs to external suppliers by providing detailed specifications, interactive prototypes, and asset libraries that reduce ambiguity and ensure deliverables meet exact requirements. Reduce procurement cycle times and improve vendor outcomes through clear design communication.
