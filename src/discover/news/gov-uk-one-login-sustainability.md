The GOV.UK One Login team has made significant progress in reducing cloud emissions, achieving a reduction of approximately 40 tonnes of CO2e per month from February to June. By partnering with Green Pixie to measure One Login's cloud emissions, the team demonstrated the positive impact of optimizing cloud services on both sustainability and cost reduction.

The initiative has now onboarded over 50 government services, with more than 2.5 million people having already proved their identity through the system. GOV.UK One Login continues to make digital services more sustainable and scalable, with a focus on embedding sustainability principles throughout the team.

Looking ahead, the team is exploring how to deliver further benefits for users and government, including the possibility of encompassing a wider range of public services, including local government. This expansion could help residents access local services using a single login, streamlining the user experience across multiple government touch points.
