⚠️ **Campaign products require pre-commitments from public sector organisations before development proceeds.**

This catalog shows innovative products currently in the campaign phase - seeking collective backing from government bodies before full development. These solutions address specific public sector challenges and require minimum commitment levels to ensure viability and shared development costs.

Campaign products offer:

- **Collaborative funding** - shared development costs across participating organisations
- **Tailored solutions** - built specifically for UK public sector needs
- **Early adopter benefits** - influence product direction and get priority access
- **Risk mitigation** - proven demand before full development investment

**How it works**: Express interest and commitment during the campaign phase. Once minimum commitments are reached, development begins with participating organisations as founding customers.
