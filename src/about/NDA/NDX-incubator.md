A key element of this programme is the implementation of "incubators". These incubators will serve as pilot projects, pairing public sector organisations with cloud service providers to test different commercial models and identify solutions to the challenges outlined in the sources.

**Benefits for Public Sector Organisations:**

- **Accelerated Cloud Adoption:** The incubators are designed to overcome the lengthy activation processes that currently hinder cloud adoption in the public sector. By providing "high touch" support and experimenting with different procurement models, the programme aims to reduce the typical 6-9 month activation period and the associated costs. This accelerated adoption will enable public sector organisations to realise the benefits of cloud computing, such as increased agility, scalability, and cost savings, more quickly.
- **Access to Expertise and Innovation:** Participating public sector organisations will benefit from working closely with leading cloud service providers. This collaboration will give them access to technical expertise, best practices, and innovative solutions that they might not otherwise have. This will be particularly beneficial for smaller departments or those with limited technical expertise, helping to bridge the digital divide within the government.
- **Tailored Solutions and Improved Service Delivery:** The incubators will focus on addressing the specific needs and challenges of the participating public sector organisations. This will involve developing tailored cloud solutions that meet their unique requirements and improve the delivery of public services. The emphasis on a "build once, use many" approach ensures that the solutions developed during the incubators can be replicated and scaled across other parts of the public sector.

**Benefits for Industry Participants (Cloud Service Providers):**

- **Early Access to the Public Sector Market:** The NDX incubator programme provides cloud service providers with a valuable opportunity to engage with the UK public sector and demonstrate the value of their offerings. By participating in these pilot projects, they can showcase their capabilities, gain a deeper understanding of the public sector's needs, and establish themselves as trusted partners.
- **Co-Creation and Innovation:** The collaborative nature of the incubators fosters co-creation and innovation between cloud service providers and public sector organisations. This provides an environment for developing new solutions, refining existing offerings, and exploring innovative approaches to cloud service delivery within the context of the UK public sector's unique requirements.
- **Influence on Policy and Standards:** The insights gained from the incubator programme will feed into the development of the NDX and its associated policies and standards. By actively participating in this process, cloud service providers can help shape the future of cloud adoption in the UK public sector and ensure that the NDX aligns with industry best practices and emerging technologies.

The NDX incubator programme offers a mutually beneficial approach to tackling the challenges of cloud adoption and digital transformation in the UK public sector. By fostering collaboration and innovation, the programme aims to create a more efficient, effective, and secure digital infrastructure for the delivery of public services.
