It will build on existing initiatives such as the data marketplace, the National Data Library, and the Cloud Marketplace. NDX is a "mash-up" of several different technologies and platforms, including an API gateway, an event bus, a data streaming service, Reddit, StackOverflow, and GitHub.

By facilitating the sharing of data and resources, the NDX aims to address the challenge of siloed working within the public sector. It is hoped that this will foster collaboration and prevent duplication of effort.

### The NDX has the following objectives:

- Provide **standardized and secure cloud environments** to reduce activation time and costs for departments.
- Offer a **marketplace for pre-approved cloud services** to simplify the procurement process and ensure compliance with government standards.
- Establish a **community platform** to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration amongst digital data professionals.
- Provide **access to high-value datasets and APIs** to encourage data sharing and collaboration between departments.

==**IMAGE DESCRIPTION: A DIAGRAM WITH TWO PATHWAYS. THE FIRST SHOWS A LONG AND WINDING ROAD LABELED "TRADITIONAL CLOUD PROCUREMENT." THE SECOND SHOWS A STRAIGHT PATH LABELED "NDX" THAT IS CLEARLY SHORTER AND MORE DIRECT.**==

The hope is that by simplifying the process of accessing and utilising cloud services, the NDX will accelerate cloud adoption across the UK public sector and address issues such as prolonged activation times and inconsistent cloud environments.

This centralization of data is intended to address the current lack of standardization and improve data sharing practices within the public sector.
