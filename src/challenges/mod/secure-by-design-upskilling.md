## Challenge Summary

**How do we up-skill UK defence in 'Secure by Design' approaches?**

MOD policy assumes that those engaged with 'Secure by Design' activities are suitably qualified and experienced. However, applying 'Secure by Design' requires a 'one team' approach across UK defence where different roles - both within MOD and the broader supply chain - play a part in delivering and maintaining resilient capabilities.

Each role is associated with a body of knowledge, and effective and efficient approaches are needed to deliver this knowledge to create a robust Suitably Qualified and Experienced Personnel (SQEP) pipeline.

## Problem Context

The Ministry of Defence has mandated 'Secure by Design' approaches across all projects delivering capabilities or services, ensuring security is considered from the outset and through life. This represents a fundamental shift in design thinking about security, requiring new skills and competencies across the entire defence ecosystem.

### Current Challenges

- **Skills Gap**: Insufficient personnel with 'Secure by Design' expertise across MOD and supply chain
- **Knowledge Distribution**: Fragmented understanding of what constitutes effective 'Secure by Design' knowledge
- **Training Delivery**: Lack of scalable, effective mechanisms for delivering specialized knowledge
- **Competency Assessment**: No standardized framework for measuring 'Secure by Design' capabilities

### Scale of Impact

- **£50M+ annual value** in improved security outcomes and reduced capability vulnerabilities
- **10,000+ personnel** across MOD and supply chain requiring up-skilling
- **Critical capability protection** for national security interests
- **Supply chain strengthening** to support UK defence industrial base

## Challenge Requirements

We are seeking innovative solutions that address one or more of the following sub-challenges:

### 1. Mapping the Body of Knowledge

**Challenge**: Define the complete knowledge landscape for MOD's 'Secure by Design' approach

**Requirements**:

- Map relevant knowledge from the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK)
- Identify intersecting knowledge areas (safety, software, systems, human factors engineering)
- Define knowledge requirements for different roles and experience levels
- Create a comprehensive curriculum framework

**Success Metrics**:

- Complete knowledge mapping covering all relevant domains
- Role-specific competency definitions
- Integration with existing UK defence training standards

### 2. Delivery Mechanisms

**Challenge**: Create scalable, effective training delivery mechanisms for diverse audiences

**Requirements**:

- Support for graduates, apprentices, and experienced professionals
- Integration with undergraduate/postgraduate programmes
- Flexible delivery models (online, in-person, blended)
- Continuous learning and professional development pathways

**Success Metrics**:

- Training programmes delivered to 1,000+ personnel annually
- Integration with 10+ academic institutions
- 90%+ completion rates with demonstrated competency improvement

### 3. Competency Frameworks

**Challenge**: Develop measurable competency frameworks for different expertise levels

**Requirements**:

- Awareness, practitioner, and expert level definitions
- Skills measurement and assessment tools
- Career progression pathways
- Industry-wide standards for MOD and suppliers

**Success Metrics**:

- Standardized competency framework adopted across MOD
- Assessment tools with validated measurement criteria
- Professional certification pathway established

## Proposed Solution Characteristics

Successful solutions should demonstrate:

- **Scalability**: Ability to train thousands of personnel annually
- **Effectiveness**: Measurable improvement in 'Secure by Design' capabilities
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing MOD and industry training systems
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches to knowledge delivery and competency development
- **Sustainability**: Long-term viability and continuous improvement mechanisms

## Response Guidelines

### Phase 1: Initial Proposal (Due: March 31, 2025)

- **Problem analysis** and proposed approach (5 pages maximum)
- **Technical solution** overview with key innovations
- **Delivery timeline** and implementation plan
- **Team credentials** and relevant experience
- **Initial cost estimates** and resource requirements

### Phase 2: Detailed Development (Selected proposals)

- **Comprehensive solution** design and architecture
- **Pilot programme** proposal for testing and validation
- **Business case** with detailed cost-benefit analysis
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Campaign readiness** plan for scaling successful pilots

## Support Available

MOD will provide selected solution providers with:

- **Subject matter expertise** access to 'Secure by Design' practitioners
- **Pilot environments** for testing and validation
- **Data access** to existing training programmes and competency assessments
- **Stakeholder engagement** with key MOD and industry partners
- **Campaign support** for successful solutions requiring cross-sector investment

## Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be assessed on:

1. **Innovation** (25%): Novel approaches and technologies
2. **Feasibility** (25%): Technical and practical viability
3. **Impact** (20%): Potential for transformational change
4. **Scalability** (15%): Ability to scale across defence ecosystem
5. **Team** (15%): Relevant expertise and track record
