## Challenge Overview

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) faces critical challenges in monitoring fish populations across UK waters to support sustainable fisheries management, enforce fishing quotas, and protect marine ecosystems. Current monitoring methods are costly, time-intensive, and provide limited real-time insights.

We seek innovative AI-powered solutions that can integrate satellite imagery, sonar data, environmental sensors, and fishing vessel tracking to provide comprehensive, real-time fish population assessments at scale.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

- **Manual Survey Limitations**: Traditional fish stock assessments rely on periodic research vessel surveys covering limited areas
- **Data Fragmentation**: Multiple data sources (satellite, sonar, environmental, vessel tracking) exist in isolation
- **Real-time Gaps**: Significant delays between data collection and actionable insights for fisheries management
- **Scale Constraints**: Inability to monitor vast ocean areas continuously with current methods
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Difficulty detecting illegal fishing activities and quota violations in real-time

### Operational Impact

- Inaccurate fish stock assessments leading to unsustainable fishing quotas
- £45M annual losses from fish stock depletion and ecosystem damage
- Limited enforcement capabilities for marine protected areas
- Delayed response to environmental changes affecting fish populations
- Increased risk of overfishing and species extinction

## Technical Requirements

### Core Capabilities Needed

1. **Satellite Image Analysis**

   - Real-time processing of optical and radar satellite imagery
   - Detection of fish shoals, feeding patterns, and migration routes
   - Integration with ocean temperature, chlorophyll, and current data

2. **AI/ML Integration**

   - Machine learning models for fish species identification and counting
   - Predictive analytics for population trends and migration patterns
   - Computer vision for automated analysis of underwater footage

3. **Multi-Source Data Fusion**

   - Integration of satellite imagery, sonar data, environmental sensors
   - Fishing vessel AIS tracking and catch reporting systems
   - Weather, temperature, and oceanographic data correlation

4. **Real-time Processing**
   - Near real-time analysis and alert generation
   - Dashboard interfaces for marine biologists and enforcement teams
   - Automated reporting for quota management and conservation decisions

### Performance Standards

- **Coverage**: Monitor 200,000+ km² of UK territorial waters
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ accuracy in fish population estimates
- **Latency**: Real-time alerts within 30 minutes of detection
- **Integration**: Connect with existing DEFRA systems and databases
- **Scalability**: Handle petabytes of satellite and sensor data annually

## Success Metrics

### Primary Outcomes

- **50%+ improvement** in fish stock assessment accuracy
- **75% reduction** in monitoring costs compared to vessel-based surveys
- **Real-time detection** of illegal fishing activities and quota violations
- **£60M+ annual savings** from improved fisheries management
- **Enhanced conservation** of marine protected areas and endangered species

### Performance Indicators

- Number of fish populations accurately tracked and monitored
- Reduction in time between data collection and management decisions
- Improvement in fishing quota accuracy and sustainability metrics
- Increase in successful prosecution of illegal fishing activities
- Enhancement of marine ecosystem health indicators

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Assessment (40%)

- AI model accuracy and reliability in diverse marine conditions
- Scalability and performance of data processing systems
- Integration capabilities with existing DEFRA infrastructure
- Innovation in satellite imagery analysis and computer vision

### Operational Viability (35%)

- Cost-effectiveness compared to current monitoring methods
- User experience for marine biologists and enforcement officers
- Deployment timeline and implementation complexity
- Training requirements and change management considerations

### Impact Potential (25%)

- Demonstrable improvement in fisheries management outcomes
- Contribution to marine conservation and ecosystem protection
- Economic benefits for fishing industry and coastal communities
- Alignment with UK government sustainability goals

## Available Data Sources

### DEFRA Datasets

- Historical fish stock assessment data (20+ years)
- Fishing vessel licensing and catch reporting records
- Marine protected area boundaries and regulations
- Environmental monitoring data from coastal stations

### External Data Access

- Copernicus Sentinel satellite imagery (ESA)
- MetOffice marine weather and oceanographic data
- Crown Estate seabed mapping and habitat information
- International fish migration and spawning data

### Real-time Feeds

- Fishing vessel AIS tracking data
- Environmental sensor networks (temperature, salinity, pH)
- Weather and ocean current forecasting systems
- Marine traffic and shipping route information

## Engagement Opportunities

### Industry Collaboration

- **Initial Briefing**: February 2025 technical workshop for potential solution providers
- **Pilot Phase**: 6-month proof-of-concept with selected partners
- **Data Access**: Secure API access to DEFRA marine datasets for development
- **Expert Advisory**: Marine biologists and fisheries experts available for consultation

### Development Support

- Access to DEFRA marine research facilities and test vessels
- Collaboration with UK Space Agency for satellite data access
- Partnership opportunities with marine conservation organizations
- Integration support with existing fisheries management systems
