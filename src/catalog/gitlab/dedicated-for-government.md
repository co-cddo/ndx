## About GitLab Dedicated for Government

GitLab Dedicated for Government is a comprehensive DevSecOps platform designed for UK public sector organisations that require the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection. It provides a fully isolated, single-tenant SaaS solution that helps government agencies streamline software development while meeting complex compliance requirements, aligned with UK government standards.

## Key features

### Secure DevOps platform

The platform offers a complete DevSecOps solution that integrates security into every stage of the development pipeline. This includes Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), dependency scanning, and secret detection, ensuring that security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed early in the development process.

### UK Compliance and security

GitLab Dedicated for Government provides robust compliance capabilities to help organisations meet UK regulatory requirements. It supports ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials Plus, and other UK government security standards, with built-in features for audit logging, access controls, and encryption at rest and in transit.

### Private networking and isolation

As a single-tenant SaaS solution, GitLab Dedicated for Government provides infrastructure-level isolation, ensuring that your data stays within your account boundary and can be hosted in UK data centres to meet data sovereignty requirements. This level of isolation is critical for organisations that handle sensitive information.

### Operational efficiency

By removing the overhead of platform management, GitLab Dedicated for Government allows teams to focus on software delivery rather than infrastructure maintenance. This results in faster development cycles and improved productivity, helping UK government departments deliver digital services more efficiently.

## Business needs

### Modern software delivery

GitLab enables UK government agencies to modernise their approach to software delivery, moving from traditional waterfall methodologies to more agile, DevOps-oriented approaches. This shift helps organisations deliver software faster and with higher quality, supporting the Government Digital Service (GDS) standards.

### Enhanced security posture

With security integrated throughout the development process, GitLab helps UK government organisations maintain a strong security posture. Automated security checks continuously monitor for vulnerabilities, enabling real-time detection and mitigation in line with National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance.

### Cross-department collaboration

The platform provides tools for effective collaboration among development, security, and operations teams across different government departments. This cross-functional collaboration leads to better outcomes and reduced time-to-market for new applications and services, supporting joined-up government initiatives.

### Risk reduction

By providing a secure, compliant environment for software development, GitLab helps UK government organisations reduce risk and ensure that their applications meet the highest standards of security and reliability, supporting departmental risk management frameworks.
