GOV.UK Forms is a new platform that makes it easy to create accessible online forms for GOV.UK. Currently in development, this service will enable government organisations to build and publish forms without needing coding skills or technical knowledge.

As part of the GOV.UK Digital Service Platform, GOV.UK Forms will provide a simple way to create forms that are fully accessible, secure, and consistent with GOV.UK design standards from day one.

## What GOV.UK Forms offers

### No-code form building

Create professional government forms using a simple drag-and-drop interface. No technical skills required - anyone can build forms that meet government standards.

### Built-in accessibility

All forms automatically meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigable, and designed for users with disabilities.

### GOV.UK design consistency

Forms automatically use the GOV.UK Design System, ensuring consistent branding and user experience across all government services.

### Secure data handling

Government-grade security built in from the start. All form submissions are encrypted and handled according to government data protection standards.

### Instant publishing

### Mobile-optimized

All forms work perfectly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. Responsive design ensures forms are usable on any screen size.

## Current development status

GOV.UK Forms is currently in active development with early access available for select government partners:

### Early access program

Government organisations can request early access to help shape the development of the platform. Feedback from early users directly influences feature development.

### Partnership with Insolvency Service

The first live form was built in partnership with the Insolvency Service, demonstrating the platform's capabilities for real government services.

### Continuous improvement

The platform is being developed iteratively based on user research and feedback from government organisations using the service.

Additional features and capabilities are being developed based on identified needs across government departments and agencies.

## Benefits for government organisations
