Manchester's CityVerve project is focusing on smart lighting, health and social care monitoring, and mobility improvements, with notable success in implementing adaptive street lighting and IoT devices for health monitoring.

Bristol has established itself as a model for collaboration in smart city development through the Bristol Is Open project, which creates a city-scale testbed for smart technologies. The city is also making significant investments in smart grids and renewable energy, positioning itself as a leader in sustainable urban development. These initiatives showcase the UK's commitment to creating smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable urban environments.
