The Local Digital Collaboration Unit has made remarkable progress in supporting local government with digital transformation initiatives. Recent achievements include investments in data standards, the development of a comprehensive cyber resilience assessment service, and the launch of an ambitious three-year plan for the Open Referral UK data standard, which could potentially deliver millions of pounds in annual savings for local authorities.

The Unit's work is directly addressing key challenges faced by local councils as they seek to modernize their services and improve efficiency. By providing shared resources and expertise, the initiative is helping to standardize approaches to digital transformation across local government.

Additionally, the Unit has made significant progress in digital planning reform, with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) launching two beta products funded by the Local Digital Fund. These innovations aim to streamline planning processes, making them more efficient and user-friendly for both councils and citizens.
