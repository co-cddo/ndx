For instance, the UK already utilizes a [service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), a [technology code of practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice), and assets like the [Secure by Design](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/).

The National Digital Code will incorporate the following:

- **Refreshed technical guidance:** Recognizing that the quality of existing technical assets is "highly variable," the Code will focus on updating and improving existing technical guidance for developing and deploying digital services. To ensure the guidance is comprehensive and relevant, it will be created with input from the 100,000 digital data professionals working across the UK public sector.
- **Code of conduct:** Building on the idea that "digital data is not just the job of digital data professionals," the Code will establish a code of conduct for all public servants involved in the ownership and delivery of digital services. This code of conduct will establish ethical standards for working with data to ensure responsible, high-integrity digital service delivery.
