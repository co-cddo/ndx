The Government Digital Service (GDS) has published "A Blueprint for Modern Digital Government," a comprehensive document outlining six priorities for public sector digital reform. The blueprint addresses key areas including joining up public sector services, harnessing the power of AI, strengthening digital infrastructure, elevating leadership, investing in talent, and procuring for growth and innovation.

This forward-looking document marks the start of an important conversation about the future of digital government and will be co-developed with stakeholders across the public sector and tech companies. The blueprint aims to drive efficiency, enhance user experiences, and promote innovation in public services.

In the coming months, the digital centre will launch five bold and transparent kickstarter initiatives, including a GOV.UK App, to accelerate work in priority areas such as local government and with the Government Commercial Function.
