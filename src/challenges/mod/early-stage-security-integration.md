## Challenge Summary

**How do we incorporate 'Secure by Design' into the very earliest stages of capability acquisition?**

In theory, 'Secure by Design' should be applied at the outset of a programme or project. In practice, a military capability's form and functionality is still emerging at such an early stage, taking the form of little more than a single statement of user need.

Military capabilities primarily exist to deliver some effect for UK defence, and cyber security will always be a secondary goal. The challenge is incorporating security considerations without interfering with programme momentum or increasing costs to the point where the capability itself needs to be reconsidered.

## Problem Context

Traditional approaches to capability acquisition often treat security as a later consideration, leading to costly retrofitting and suboptimal security outcomes. However, integrating security at the earliest stages—when requirements are barely formed—presents unique challenges requiring innovative approaches.

### Current Challenges

- **Emerging Requirements**: Functional and security requirements are still being discovered
- **Multiple Stakeholders**: Security, safety, and domain experts often work in isolation
- **Programme Momentum**: Early security considerations must not derail programme timelines
- **Cost Sensitivity**: Security additions at early stages can trigger capability reassessment
- **Uncertainty Management**: High uncertainty in both functional and security domains

### Scale of Impact

- **£100M+ annual value** through early security integration across all programmes
- **200+ major programmes** benefiting from improved early-stage security
- **Reduced total costs** through avoiding expensive security retrofits
- **Enhanced capability protection** from inception through operations
- **Shortened acquisition timelines** through integrated engineering approaches

## Challenge Requirements

We are seeking innovative solutions that address one or more of the following sub-challenges:

### 1. Requirements Coherence

**Challenge**: Support coherent engineering of functional and non-functional requirements at early stages

**Requirements**:

- Tools for simultaneous security, safety, and human factors analysis
- Requirements elicitation techniques that capture emerging security needs
- Integration mechanisms for diverse requirements domains
- Evidence generation for 'Secure by Design' assurance

**Success Metrics**:

- 90% of programmes using integrated requirements approaches
- 50% reduction in requirements-related changes post-concept phase
- Comprehensive security evidence available at concept gate

### 2. Pan-DLOD Security Integration

**Challenge**: Model security threats across all Defence Lines of Development (DLODs)

**Requirements**:

- Cross-DLOD threat modeling capabilities
- Interdisciplinary security analysis tools
- Threat assessment techniques for non-technical DLODs
- Security risk aggregation across capability dimensions

**Success Metrics**:

- Complete DLOD security coverage for all major programmes
- Integrated security models spanning training, equipment, personnel, information, doctrine, organisation, infrastructure, and logistics
- 70% improvement in cross-DLOD security threat identification

### 3. Operational Analysis Integration

**Challenge**: Integrate security considerations with Operational Analysis (OA) activities

**Requirements**:

- Security-aware operational modeling and simulation
- Risk appetite formulation incorporating security dimensions
- Feedback mechanisms from 'Secure by Design' to operational analysis
- Decision support tools incorporating security trade-offs

**Success Metrics**:

- Security factors integrated into all major OA studies
- Improved decision making quality with security-aware analysis
- 60% better alignment between operational and security requirements

## Proposed Solution Characteristics

Successful solutions should demonstrate:

- **Early Applicability**: Effective when requirements are still emerging
- **Lightweight Integration**: Minimal overhead on existing programme processes
- **Scalability**: Applicable across diverse capability types and scales
- **Evidence Generation**: Produces artifacts required for 'Secure by Design' assurance
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Facilitates collaboration across security and domain experts

## Technical Approaches of Interest

We are particularly interested in solutions incorporating:

- **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**: Integrated security and functional modeling
- **Digital Engineering**: Virtual environments for early security testing
- **Machine Learning**: Automated requirements analysis and security pattern recognition
- **Simulation and Modeling**: Early security risk assessment through virtual scenarios
- **Agile/DevSecOps**: Iterative security integration approaches
- **Risk Assessment Frameworks**: Quantitative security risk modeling
- **Design Thinking**: Human-centered approaches to security requirements

## Response Guidelines

### Phase 1: Methodology Proposal (Due: May 15, 2025)

- **Approach overview** and theoretical foundation (6 pages maximum)
- **Integration strategy** with existing acquisition processes
- **Tool requirements** and implementation approach
- **Validation plan** using real programme scenarios
- **Cost-benefit analysis** and resource requirements

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Selected proposals)

- **Working tools and processes** demonstrating core capabilities
- **Pilot programme** execution with real MOD programmes
- **Stakeholder feedback** and process refinement
- **Scalability assessment** and deployment planning
- **Business case development** for full adoption

## Support Available

MOD will provide selected solution providers with:

- **Programme access** to real early-stage capability development projects
- **Stakeholder engagement** with capability managers and requirements teams
- **Subject matter expertise** across security, safety, and domain areas
- **Data access** to historical programme information and lessons learned
- **Process integration support** with existing acquisition frameworks
- **Validation environments** for testing approaches with realistic scenarios

## Success Stories

Examples of early successes in this domain:

- **Integrated Requirements Tools**: Early-stage tools capturing security and functional needs simultaneously
- **DLOD Security Models**: Comprehensive frameworks addressing security across all defence lines
- **Security-Aware OA**: Enhanced operational analysis incorporating security considerations
- **Digital Security Twins**: Virtual environments for early security validation

## Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be assessed on:

1. **Process Integration** (25%): Seamless integration with existing acquisition processes
2. **Early Applicability** (25%): Effectiveness when requirements are still emerging
3. **Evidence Quality** (20%): Quality of security evidence generated for assurance
4. **Cost Effectiveness** (15%): Minimal impact on programme costs and timelines
5. **Stakeholder Adoption** (15%): Ease of adoption by diverse stakeholder communities

## Implementation Phases

Successful solutions will be implemented through:

### Phase A: Pilot Programmes (Months 1-6)

- Selection of 3-5 early-stage programmes for piloting
- Tool deployment and process integration
- Stakeholder training and adoption support
- Initial effectiveness assessment

### Phase B: Scaled Deployment (Months 7-18)

- Rollout to 20+ programmes across different capability domains
- Process refinement based on pilot lessons
- Integration with MOD acquisition systems
- Comprehensive evaluation and optimization

### Phase C: Full Adoption (Months 19-36)

- MOD-wide deployment across all relevant programmes
- Training programme for all acquisition staff
- Policy and process updates to mandate approaches
- Continuous improvement and evolution
