# Cookies policy

This page explains how the National Data Exchange (NDX) uses cookies and browser storage.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website. They store information about your visit, such as your preferences or whether you're signed in.

## Cookies we use

NDX uses only essential cookies required for the service to function. We do not use cookies for advertising or tracking.

### Essential cookies

| Cookie | Purpose | Expiry |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `__Host-isb_sso_token` | Stores your authentication token to keep you signed in | Session |
| `NDX` | Identifies which version of the site you're viewing | Session |

## Browser storage

We also use browser storage (sessionStorage and localStorage) for the following purposes:

### sessionStorage

sessionStorage is cleared when you close your browser tab.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `auth-return-to` | Remembers where to redirect you after signing in |
| `signup-welcome-back` | Shows a welcome message if you tried to sign up with an existing account |
| `aup-agreed` | Records that you've accepted the acceptable use policy |

### localStorage

localStorage persists until you clear your browser data.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ndx-auth-state` | Stores your authentication state to show sign in/sign out buttons |

## We do not use tracking cookies

NDX does not use:

- Google Analytics or other tracking services
- Social media sharing cookies
- Advertising cookies
- Third-party analytics

## Managing cookies

Most browsers let you control cookies through their settings. You can:

- See what cookies are stored
- Delete individual cookies
- Block all cookies from specific sites
- Block all third-party cookies
- Delete all cookies when you close your browser

However, if you block essential cookies, you won't be able to use NDX's authenticated features.
