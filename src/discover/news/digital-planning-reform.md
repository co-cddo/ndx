The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has launched two beta products for digital planning reform, funded by the Local Digital Fund. This initiative marks a significant step forward in the government's efforts to modernize the planning process and improve efficiency in local government planning departments.

The beta products aim to streamline planning applications and decision-making processes, making them more transparent, consistent, and user-friendly for both planning officials and citizens. By digitizing and standardizing planning procedures, the initiative will reduce administrative burdens and accelerate the planning approval process.

This digital transformation of the planning system supports the government's broader agenda of improving public services through technology. The new digital planning tools will help local authorities manage growth more effectively, ensuring that communities can develop in a sustainable and well-planned manner while reducing the time and resources required to process planning applications.
