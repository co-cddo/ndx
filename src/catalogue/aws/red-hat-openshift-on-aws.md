Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides an integrated experience with OpenShift. You can use the wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning (ML), networking, mobile, and other services to build secure and scalable applications faster.

### Turnkey application platform

A turnkey application platform with built-in CI/CD, monitoring and developer tooling to get started quickly and offload the ongoing management of your applications.

### Native AWS service and integration

A native AWS service accessed on demand from the AWS Management Console. Take advantage of seamless integration with other AWS cloud native services and access Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS GovCloud to address security and compliance requirements.

### Integrated support and billing

Jointly operated and supported by Red Hat and AWS with a 99.95% uptime SLA. Customers will also receive a single bill from AWS for both OpenShift and AWS consumption.

### Backed by SRE expertise

Reduces operational complexity with automated deployment and management, backed by a global Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. Focus on building and scaling value-add applications, rather than managing infrastructure.

## Business Needs

### Scalable digital services

Accelerate the delivery of citizen-facing applications by giving development teams a secure, fully managed Kubernetes platform on AWS. Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) helps reduce time to value with built-in automation, enterprise-grade security, and consistent tooling across development and operations.

### Flexible AI and data workloads

Support AI and data initiatives at scale with a platform optimised for running complex models and managing large datasets in AWS. ROSA enables organisations to deploy AI assistants, natural language processing tools, and real-time analytics while maintaining governance and compliance through integrated OpenShift and AWS services.

### Hybrid cloud consistency

Deliver a consistent application experience across hybrid environments. ROSA enables teams to build once and deploy anywhere - from on-premises Red Hat OpenShift to AWS - ensuring portability, service continuity, and alignment with open standards and cloud-first strategies.

### Secure modernisation

Modernise legacy systems with a secure, fully managed container platform. ROSA includes automated updates, role-based access control, and built-in monitoring, helping teams meet security and compliance requirements while modernising infrastructure at pace.

### Developer productivity and automation

Boost developer productivity with native support for CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, and infrastructure-as-code. ROSA embeds DevSecOps into the development lifecycle, so teams can focus on delivering value without worrying about cluster operations or platform maintenance.

### Cost-efficient platform operations

Optimise cloud spending by consolidating workloads on a managed Kubernetes platform with autoscaling, usage-based pricing, and resource governance. ROSA reduces operational overheads by combining OpenShift innovation with AWS infrastructure efficiency and Red Hat’s SRE-led managed service.
