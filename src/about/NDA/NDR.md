It will take a three-pronged approach to managing national-level threats, including:

- **Real-time monitoring and response:** The platform will monitor for national-level threats and enable a coordinated response to mitigate potential damage.
- **Supply chain enhancement:** Recognizing that the resilience of the UK's digital infrastructure is dependent on its supply chain, the platform will seek to enhance the security and resilience of the entire digital supply chain.
- **Post-incident review and learning:** The platform will play a key role in post-incident reviews, identifying vulnerabilities and improving the entire sector's ability to withstand future threats.
