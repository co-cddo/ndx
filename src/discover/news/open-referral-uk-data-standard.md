The Local Digital Collaboration Unit has launched an ambitious three-year plan for the Open Referral UK data standard, which has the potential to deliver millions of pounds in annual savings for local authorities. This initiative represents a significant advancement in standardizing data approaches across local government, facilitating more efficient information sharing and service delivery.

The Open Referral UK data standard provides a common framework for organizing and sharing information about services, making it easier for local authorities to collaborate and for citizens to access the services they need. By adopting a consistent approach to data, councils can reduce duplication of effort, improve data quality, and enhance service discoverability.

This initiative aligns with the government's broader strategy to improve data interoperability and standards across the public sector. As more local authorities adopt the Open Referral UK standard, the benefits are expected to multiply, creating a more connected and efficient local government landscape that better serves citizens while reducing operational costs.
