The UK government's pioneering Cloud First policy is celebrating its 12th anniversary, marking more than a decade of transformative impact on public services. Since its introduction, the policy has driven widespread cloud adoption across government, with approximately 60% of UK government and public sector IT systems now running on cloud services.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) stands out as a notable success story, having effectively leveraged cloud technology to simplify operations, enhance internal collaboration, and significantly reduce reliance on legacy systems. This approach has enabled greater agility in service delivery while improving cost-effectiveness.

The Cloud First policy continues to evolve and remains a cornerstone of the government's technology strategy, supporting departments in their digital transformation journeys. As cloud technology advances, the policy provides a solid foundation for further innovation in public service delivery, ensuring that government IT remains modern, efficient, and responsive to changing needs.
