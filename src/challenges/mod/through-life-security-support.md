## Challenge Summary

**How do we support 'Secure by Design' through the entire operational life of defence capabilities?**

Many defence platforms are long running. Their engineering can take years, with some capabilities remaining operational for several decades, sometimes beyond the initial planned obsolescence date. The rationale that underpins design decisions may rely on assumptions which may be forgotten with the passage of time, the drive for innovation, changes to operating environments, and a new generation of engineers.

'Secure by Design' approaches need to be sustained as long as the capabilities they support—potentially spanning multiple generations of personnel, technology, and threats.

## Problem Context

Defence capabilities operate in a unique environment where systems designed today may remain in service for 30-50 years. During this extended lifecycle, threat landscapes evolve, coalition partnerships change, technology advances, and operational environments shift dramatically. Maintaining security posture across such timescales requires fundamentally new approaches to through-life support.

### Current Challenges

- **Design Rationale Loss**: Security decisions and assumptions forgotten over time
- **Technology Evolution**: Original security measures become obsolete
- **Personnel Turnover**: Loss of institutional knowledge across generations
- **Threat Evolution**: New attack vectors not considered in original design
- **Coalition Dynamics**: Changing partnership requirements and security frameworks
- **Operational Tempo**: High-tempo operations requiring rapid security adaptations

### Scale of Impact

- **£150M+ annual value** through improved through-life security management
- **300+ legacy platforms** requiring enhanced security support
- **Multi-decade timescales** spanning 30-50 year capability lifecycles
- **International coalition** security and interoperability benefits
- **Critical infrastructure protection** across operational environments

## Challenge Requirements

We are seeking innovative solutions that address one or more of the following sub-challenges:

### 1. Continuous Risk Management

**Challenge**: Automate continuous security monitoring and risk assessment across operational lifecycles

**Requirements**:

- Real-time capability monitoring and security assessment
- Automated threat intelligence integration
- Predictive security risk modeling
- Dynamic risk threshold management
- Integration with operational decision-making processes

**Success Metrics**:

- 95% automation of routine security assessments
- Real-time threat response within 15 minutes
- 80% improvement in security incident prediction accuracy
- Continuous risk visibility for 100% of critical capabilities

### 2. Coalition Partner Interoperability

**Challenge**: Enable secure interoperability with coalition partners while maintaining security posture

**Requirements**:

- Dynamic coalition security framework adaptation
- Real-time security posture sharing between partners
- Automated security policy negotiation and enforcement
- Multi-national security standard reconciliation
- Cross-border secure capability integration

**Success Metrics**:

- Seamless integration with 20+ coalition partners
- 90% reduction in security integration time for new partners
- Real-time security posture visibility across coalition operations
- Zero security incidents due to coalition interoperability

### 3. Security Research Ecosystem Development

**Challenge**: Build and sustain long-term research capability for evolving security challenges

**Requirements**:

- Academic and industry research partnership frameworks
- Long-term research funding and sustainability models
- Knowledge transfer mechanisms from research to operations
- International research collaboration protocols
- Innovation pipeline from research to deployed capabilities

**Success Metrics**:

- 50+ active research partnerships with leading institutions
- £20M+ annual research investment sustainability
- 5+ breakthrough security technologies deployed annually
- International research leadership in defence security

## Proposed Solution Characteristics

Successful solutions should demonstrate:

- **Longevity**: Viable and maintainable across multi-decade timescales
- **Adaptability**: Capable of evolving with changing threats and environments
- **Automation**: Minimal human intervention for routine security operations
- **Scalability**: Applicable across hundreds of diverse capabilities
- **Resilience**: Continued operation under various operational constraints
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with diverse coalition partner systems

## Technical Approaches of Interest
