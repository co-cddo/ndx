As the leading cryptozoologist at my institution, I was initially dubious about UnicornCountâ„¢. However, the detection algorithms are remarkably accurate. My only criticism is the system occasionally tags particularly majestic horses as 'potential unicorns with horn concealment enchantments.' Still, a vast improvement over rainbow-baited traps.
