Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides an integrated experience with OpenShift. You can use the wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning (ML), networking, mobile, and other services to build secure and scalable applications faster.

### Turnkey application platform

A turnkey application platform with built-in CI/CD, monitoring and developer tooling to get started quickly and offload the ongoing management of your applications.

### Native AWS service and integration

A native AWS service accessed on demand from the AWS Management Console. Take advantage of seamless integration with other AWS cloud native services and access Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS GovCloud to address security and compliance requirements.

### Integrated support & billing

Jointly operated and supported by Red Hat & AWS with a 99.95% uptime SLA. Customers will also receive a single bill from AWS for both OpenShift & AWS consumption.

### Backed by SRE Expertise

Reduces operational complexity with automated deployment and management, backed by a global Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. Focus on building and scaling value-add applications, rather than managing infrastructure.

## Business Needs

### Scalable Digital Services

Deploy and manage citizen-facing applications more quickly by giving development teams a secure, fully managed platform that works across cloud and on-premises environments. Azure Red Hat OpenShift helps reduce time to launch by providing built-in automation, security features, and consistent development tools.

### Flexible AI and Data Workloads

Support AI and data initiatives with a platform that can run complex models, manage large datasets, and scale flexibly. Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows organisations to deploy AI assistants, natural language tools, and analytics pipelines while maintaining governance and operational control.

### Hybrid Cloud Consistency

Run applications reliably across environments without the risk of lock-in. With Azure Red Hat OpenShift, teams can develop once and deploy anywhere - whether in a secure data centre or the public cloud - ensuring service continuity and alignment with architectural standards.

### Secure Modernisation

Modernise legacy applications and infrastructure with a platform designed for security and compliance. Azure Red Hat OpenShift includes role-based access control, automated patching, and built-in monitoring to support secure, resilient operations from day one.

### Developer Productivity and Automation

Increase development speed by streamlining common tasks with integrated automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code. Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows teams to focus on building services, not managing environments, by embedding DevSecOps practices into everyday workflows.

### Cost-Efficient Platform Operations

Improve efficiency by consolidating applications onto a shared platform with built-in autoscaling, usage-based billing, and resource controls. Azure Red Hat OpenShift helps optimise cloud spend while enabling teams to deliver more with fewer operational overheads, leveraging Microsoft Site Reliability Engineering expertise.
