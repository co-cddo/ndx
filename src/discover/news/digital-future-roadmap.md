The Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) has released an updated roadmap for digital and data transformation, "Transforming for a Digital Future," outlining the government's strategy to transform public services and deliver world-class technology by 2025. The roadmap includes a commitment to invest £8 billion in digital, data, and technology transformation.

Key focus areas include developing digital skills for civil servants, enhancing government efficiency, and strengthening cybersecurity across public services. The roadmap builds on previous digital transformation efforts and sets ambitious targets for the next phase of digitalization in the public sector.

This strategic investment aims to replace outdated legacy systems and deliver better services and greater value for taxpayers, ensuring that the UK government remains at the forefront of digital innovation in public service delivery.
