Okta Identity is a cloud-based identity management platform that helps UK public sector organisations secure access to applications, systems, and data. It offers a comprehensive solution for workforce identity and customer identity management, designed to meet the stringent security and compliance requirements of government agencies, healthcare organisations, and educational institutions.

With Okta, public sector organisations can modernise their Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure without significant upfront investments in hardware or specialised resources. The platform's intuitive interface enables simple administration while providing powerful security controls that protect sensitive citizen data and government systems.

Get started with Okta Identity for your public sector organisation:

1. Sign up for an Okta account or sign in to your existing account
2. Configure your directory integration and identity policies
3. Set up single sign-on for your applications
4. Deploy multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
5. Monitor and manage user access with detailed reporting

Okta Identity caters to both IT administrators and end users:

- **Administrators** benefit from a centralised console for managing user lifecycles, permissions, and access policies without requiring complex coding or integration work.

- **End users** enjoy a seamless sign-in experience with single sign-on (SSO) to all their applications, self-service capabilities, and flexible authentication options that balance security with usability.

### Reduce operational costs and increase efficiency

Okta's cloud-based platform eliminates the need for on-premises identity infrastructure, reducing IT management overhead and allowing resources to be redirected to mission-critical activities. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning streamlines onboarding and offboarding processes, saving valuable time for HR and IT departments across public sector organisations.

### Strengthen security with Zero Trust architecture

Okta enables UK public sector organisations to implement Zero Trust security frameworks that verify every user and every device before granting access to applications or data. With adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA), suspicious login attempts are automatically challenged with additional verification, protecting citizen data and government services from unauthorised access.

### Maintain compliance with UK regulations

Built with compliance at its core, Okta helps public sector organisations meet security requirements including ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials Plus, and NHS Digital standards. The platform provides comprehensive audit logs, access reports, and governance controls that simplify compliance with UK data protection regulations and the UK Government Security Classification Policy.
