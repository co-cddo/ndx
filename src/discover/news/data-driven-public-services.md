The UK public sector is making substantial investments in digital technology, spending over £26 billion annually and employing nearly 100,000 digital and data professionals. This significant commitment to digital transformation is driving improvements in public service delivery and efficiency across government departments and agencies.

Flagship initiatives such as the NHS app and GOV.UK One Login have set high standards for digital public service delivery, demonstrating how technology can be leveraged to create more responsive, user-friendly government services. These successes provide valuable models for further digital innovation across the public sector.

The substantial investment in digital technology reflects the government's recognition of the transformative potential of data-driven approaches to public service delivery. By harnessing the power of data and digital tools, the public sector is working to create more personalized, efficient, and effective services that better meet the needs of citizens while delivering greater value for taxpayers.
