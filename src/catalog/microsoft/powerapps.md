Microsoft PowerApps is a low-code development platform that enables UK public sector organisations to rapidly build and deploy custom applications that address specific business challenges, without requiring extensive coding expertise. It provides comprehensive tools for creating responsive applications that work seamlessly across web and mobile devices, empowering government bodies to digitise processes and enhance citizen services.

Traditional application development often requires significant technical resources, lengthy development cycles, and specialised skills. PowerApps eliminates these barriers by offering intuitive visual tools, pre-built templates, and drag-and-drop functionality that enables both technical and non-technical staff to contribute to your organisation's digital transformation journey.

Start building custom applications with PowerApps today. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft PowerApps portal with your organisation account
2. Create a new app using a template or start from a blank canvas
3. Connect to your data sources (SharePoint, Excel, Dataverse, SQL, etc.)
4. Design your app interface using the visual editor
5. Configure business logic and workflows using formulas or Power Automate
6. Test and publish your application

PowerApps supports diverse stakeholders across your organisation:

- **Business analysts and domain experts** can design functional applications that precisely meet departmental requirements without waiting for IT resource allocation.

- **IT professionals** gain a platform that enforces security standards and governance while allowing them to extend applications with custom code when necessary.

### Accelerate digital transformation with reduced development time

PowerApps enables the rapid creation of custom applications in days or weeks rather than months, accelerating digital transformation initiatives across the public sector. Local authorities and government agencies can quickly digitise paper-based processes, automate workflows, and deploy citizen-facing services that align with the UK Government Digital Service standards, all while reducing development costs by up to 70%.

### Maintain compliance and robust security

PowerApps integrates seamlessly with Microsoft's comprehensive security framework, including role-based access controls, data loss prevention policies, and compliance with key regulations like GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. While organisations should conduct their own Data Protection Impact Assessments, PowerApps provides the security features necessary to protect sensitive citizen data and maintain public trust.

### Connect and extend existing systems

Rather than replacing legacy systems, PowerApps connects to them through over 300 pre-built connectors, extracting additional value from existing IT investments. Public sector organisations can easily integrate with Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Azure services, and third-party applications to create unified experiences that break down data silos and improve cross-departmental collaboration.

## Business Needs

### Process Digitalisation

Transform paper-based processes into digital workflows that reduce administrative burden, minimise errors, and provide audit trails. Local councils like Bournemouth, Christchurch, and Poole Council have successfully used PowerApps to streamline labour-intensive administrative tasks and improve service delivery to citizens.

### Field Worker Productivity

Equip field-based staff with mobile applications that work offline, ensuring continuous productivity for social workers, inspectors, and maintenance teams even in areas with limited connectivity. Enable real-time data collection, photo capture, and service delivery updates directly from the field.

### Citizen Self-Service Portals

Create intuitive citizen-facing portals that enable self-service for common interactions such as reporting issues, applying for permits, or accessing information. Reduce call centre volume while improving citizen satisfaction through 24/7 service availability.

### Cross-Department Collaboration

Break down information silos by building applications that facilitate data sharing and collaboration across departments while maintaining appropriate security boundaries, supporting joined-up government initiatives and holistic citizen service delivery.

### Rapid Response Applications

Quickly develop and deploy applications to address emerging needs or crises, such as grant distribution, emergency response coordination, or public health initiatives, without lengthy procurement or development cycles.

### Intelligence-Driven Service Improvement

Leverage PowerApps' AI capabilities and integration with Power BI to analyse service usage data, identify improvement opportunities, and create data-driven decision-making tools that help prioritise resources where they will have the greatest impact on citizen outcomes.
