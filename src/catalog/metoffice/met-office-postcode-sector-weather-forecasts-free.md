## What is the Postcode Sector data set?

Model-generated hourly forecasts for up to 14 days. It's available for postcode sectors (e.g. EX1 1) within the UK and Northern Ireland and larger cities in the Republic of Ireland. Provides information for over 80 parameters such as e.g. temperature, wind, rain, snow, solar, cloud and more.

Postcode Sector Data is created by blending together eight supercomputer Weather Prediction Models incorporating real-life surface, satellite cloud and radar rainfall observations. By combining models, we are able to cancel many of the errors out and produce better, more accurate forecasts.

To meet a variety of business needs Postcode Sector Data offers large number of weather parameters to choose from, including probabilistic and weather codes.

Postcode Sector Data offers a probability forecast for several parameters. This means we can express the uncertainties to the range of possible values of different parameters. Knowing the probability of certain weather events occurring will allow you to better assess risk and make informed decisions.
