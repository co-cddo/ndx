## What is NDX?

NDX (National Digital Exchange) is a government platform that helps public sector organisations discover, evaluate, and adopt digital solutions.

## Overview

> **Learning Artifact**: This is a pre-deployed demonstration environment for learning and exploration, not a production-ready product. Use it to understand how AWS AI services can enhance content management for local government.

This is the **most comprehensive AWS and AI experience** available on NDX:Try. LocalGov Drupal with AI showcases how UK councils can transform their content management with seven AI-powered capabilities, all running on a robust AWS infrastructure.

**Important**: After requesting your sandbox, the environment takes approximately **40 minutes to deploy**. This deployment happens automatically - you'll receive access credentials via email once it's ready. The deployment time reflects the comprehensive nature of this scenario, which provisions a full content management system with multiple AI integrations.

## About LocalGov Drupal

LocalGov Drupal is an open-source content management system built by UK councils, for councils. This NDX:Try scenario enhances it with AWS AI capabilities to demonstrate what's possible.

### The Platform

LocalGov Drupal addresses a fundamental challenge: local councils were spending significant resources building similar websites independently. By collaborating, councils now share development costs and benefit from each other's investments.

**Key facts:**
- **56+ councils** actively using LocalGov Drupal across the UK and Ireland
- **100+ live sites** deployed on the platform
- **19 certified suppliers** providing implementation support
- Built on **Drupal 10** with modern PHP 8.1 architecture

### Cost and Time Benefits

Councils using LocalGov Drupal report significant savings:

- **Up to 80% cost reduction** compared to traditional website builds (average £120k reduced to £20k-£60k)
- **8-12 week deployment** versus traditional 12-month timelines
- **No vendor lock-in** through open-source GPL-2.0 licensing
- **No licensing fees** - open source means no per-seat costs or annual renewals

### Standards and Accessibility

LocalGov Drupal is built to government standards:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant** - meeting UK accessibility requirements
- **GOV.UK Design System aligned** - familiar patterns for citizens
- Evidence-based design from pooled user research across 56 councils

### Governance

Since January 2023, LocalGov Drupal has been governed by the **Open Digital Cooperative** - a not-for-profit multistakeholder cooperative ensuring long-term sustainability and democratic governance by member councils and suppliers.

## Real Council Success Stories

### Waltham Forest Council

One of the first councils to join LocalGov Drupal in the beta phase:

- **£90,000 saved** in development costs
- **3-6 months** of development time saved
- **25% improvement** in user satisfaction
- **96/100 accessibility score** on SiteImprove (vs. 87 sector benchmark)
- **40% faster** page load performance
- **10-15% reduction** in calls to resolution centre

### Cumbria County Council

Demonstrated rapid improvements with limited budget:

- **21% reduction** in contact volume
- **25% faster** resolution times per contact
- **£33,000** annual potential savings
- Achieved in 6 months what they had been trying to achieve for 3 years

### What Digital Leaders Say

> "LGD is what proper local gov digital collaboration looks like. A single platform where everyone gets the benefits of each other's investment for free. Solving problems once, together."
>
> — **Neil Williams**, Chief Digital Officer at Croydon Council (former head of GOV.UK)

## Constraints

- **Budget limit**: $50 maximum spend (sufficient for extensive exploration)
- **Duration**: 24 hours from activation
- **Deployment time**: Approximately 40 minutes after requesting
- **Purpose**: Evaluation only (non-production use)
- **No cost to you** - the budget is provided by NDX:Try

## Important Notes

> **Resource Lifecycle Warning**: All resources in your sandbox will be automatically deleted when your session time expires OR when the budget limit is reached (whichever comes first). Do not store important data in this environment.

### Before Your Session Ends

- Export any configurations or code snippets you want to keep
- Take screenshots of AI feature outputs
- Document any insights about the AI capabilities
- Note which features would be most valuable for your council

### Infrastructure as Code

The resources in this scenario were deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). When building for production, we strongly recommend using CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform rather than manual console configuration. This ensures repeatability, version control, and easier compliance.
