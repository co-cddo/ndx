---

## 1. Scope & Objectives

This risk assessment by Cabinet Office Digital Services evaluates data security vulnerabilities and the potential operational risks related to the deployment of the SynapLyte™ AI platform within government IT infrastructure.

## 2. Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 2.1. Risk: Model Drift & Performance Degradation (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

**Description:** SynapLyte™'s language models may experience performance drift over time, particularly when exposed to specialized government terminology and evolving policy language. This could lead to decreased accuracy in document processing and analysis.
**Mitigation:** Implement continuous model monitoring with automated performance benchmarks. Establish quarterly model retraining cycles using curated government document sets. Deploy A/B testing framework for gradual model updates.

### 2.2. Risk: Adversarial Prompt Injection (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Critical)

**Description:** Malicious actors could attempt to manipulate the AI through carefully crafted prompts designed to bypass safety measures or extract sensitive training data. This poses risks for systems handling classified or sensitive government information.
**Mitigation:** Deploy multi-layer prompt filtering and anomaly detection. Implement strict input sanitization and output monitoring. Regular red team exercises by NCSC-certified security professionals.

### 2.3. Risk: Data Sovereignty & Cross-Border Transfer (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

**Description:** The platform's cloud infrastructure might inadvertently process or store UK government data outside approved jurisdictions, potentially violating data sovereignty requirements and creating security vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation:** Implement geo-fencing for all data processing activities. Deploy end-to-end encryption with UK-controlled key management. Establish real-time data location monitoring and automated compliance reporting.

### 2.4. Risk: Cognitive Over-Reliance & Skills Atrophy (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)

**Description:** Extended use of AI assistance for analytical and writing tasks may lead to decreased critical thinking and professional writing skills among civil servants, potentially impacting decision quality during system outages.
**Mitigation:** Mandate regular "manual mode" exercises for all users. Implement usage analytics to identify over-reliance patterns. Provide ongoing training on AI-augmented decision making vs. AI-dependent workflows.

## 3. Overall Risk Posture

Cabinet Office Digital Services assesses the SynapLyte™ platform as operationally viable with the proposed mitigations. The primary concerns revolve around maintaining human oversight, ensuring data sovereignty, and preventing adversarial exploitation. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential for safe deployment.
