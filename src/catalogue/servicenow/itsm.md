ServiceNow IT Service Management (ITSM) is a comprehensive platform that helps UK public sector organisations streamline and automate their IT service operations. It provides an end-to-end solution for managing incidents, problems, changes, and service requests while offering powerful self-service capabilities and analytics that improve both citizen and employee experiences.

While traditional IT service management often involves disparate tools, manual processes, and siloed information, ServiceNow ITSM unifies everything into a single platform. This enables public sector organisations to reduce costs, increase productivity, mitigate risks, and deliver more responsive services to citizens and employees alike.

Start transforming your IT service delivery with ServiceNow ITSM today. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Sign up for a ServiceNow account or sign in to your existing account
2. Configure your ITSM instance with UK public sector best practices
3. Set up workflows for incident, problem, and change management
4. Implement self-service portals for employees and citizens
5. Connect with existing systems through ServiceNow integrations

ServiceNow ITSM supports users across all levels of technical expertise:

- **Citizens and employees** benefit from intuitive self-service portals that make it easy to submit requests, report issues, and track progress without requiring technical knowledge.

- **IT professionals** gain access to powerful workflow automation, comprehensive dashboards, and integration capabilities that streamline operations and provide valuable insights for continuous improvement.

### Accelerate service delivery with intelligent automation

ServiceNow ITSM provides powerful workflow automation that reduces manual effort and accelerates service delivery. By automating routine tasks like ticket routing, notifications, and approvals, UK public sector organisations can resolve service issues faster and more consistently. This leads to improved citizen satisfaction, reduced operational costs, and more time for staff to focus on value-added activities that drive innovation in public services.

### Ensure compliance with UK government standards

ServiceNow works closely with UK public sector organisations to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards. The platform is available through G-Cloud, making procurement straightforward. While ServiceNow doesn't directly hold UK Cyber Essentials Plus certification, its partners who implement the solution often do, and the platform itself maintains ISO/IEC 27001 certification for information security management, ensuring that sensitive citizen and government data remains protected.

### Gain visibility and insights across services

The platform provides real-time dashboards and comprehensive reporting capabilities that offer visibility into service performance, resource utilisation, and compliance status. These insights help UK public sector leaders make data-driven decisions, identify improvement opportunities, and demonstrate value to stakeholders. By understanding service patterns and trends, organisations can proactively address issues before they impact citizens and reallocate resources to where they're needed most.

## Business needs

### Citizen service improvement

Transform citizen experiences with intuitive self-service portals, automated request fulfilment, and consistent service delivery across channels. The NHS Blood and Transplant service improved their citizen and employee experience by implementing ServiceNow's self-service portal, bringing consistency to service delivery across the organisation.

### Remote work enablement

Support flexible and remote working for public sector employees with cloud-based service management that's accessible from anywhere. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) used ServiceNow solutions to manage the redistribution of staff and transition to remote working, using tools like their 'Digi' chatbot and DWP Place IT Support solution to help staff work more effectively.

### Cost reduction through automation

Reduce operational costs by automating routine service tasks, reducing manual effort, and resolving issues faster through intelligent ticket routing and AI-powered assistance. UK government departments have saved millions of pounds annually through ServiceNow automation.

### Cross-department collaboration

Enable seamless collaboration across different government departments through unified workflows, shared knowledge bases, and consistent processes. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) used ServiceNow to connect different departments and processes to handle issues efficiently and proactively after bringing six citizen-facing applications in-house post-Brexit.

### Legacy system modernisation

Integrate with existing systems and gradually modernise legacy applications without disruption to services. ServiceNow's platform allows public sector organisations to connect their current tools while building a foundation for digital transformation.

### Risk and compliance management

Maintain comprehensive audit trails, enforce security policies, and demonstrate compliance with UK government regulations through automated controls and unified visibility. Centralising information in ServiceNow workflows allows for better monitoring and tracking of potential issues and better protection of sensitive information.
