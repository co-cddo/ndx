The National Digital Exchange (NDX) is a digital marketplace designed to transform how the public sector buys technology.

## Current phase: NDX:Try

NDX is currently offering [NDX:Try](/catalogue/tags/try-before-you-buy/) — a hands-on evaluation programme that lets public sector buyers test products before committing. Each product has its own evaluation period and budget cap, with no obligation to purchase.

This early phase allows us to:

- Test the marketplace model with real users and suppliers
- Gather feedback to shape the full platform
- Build a library of genuine user reviews

## What's next

The full NDX platform will include AI-powered supplier matching, pre-approved deals at nationally negotiated prices, and user ratings to inform purchasing decisions.
