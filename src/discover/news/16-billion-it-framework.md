The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) is set to launch a substantial £16 billion IT services procurement framework, representing a 25% expansion in scope compared to earlier proposals. The Technology Services 4 framework will cover a comprehensive range of IT service areas to support public sector digital transformation.

Key service areas in the framework include digital consultancy, service integration, infrastructure management, cybersecurity, data services, application development, and transformation projects. This significant investment highlights the government's commitment to modernizing public sector technology and enhancing service delivery.

The framework is designed to streamline the procurement process for government departments and agencies, making it easier to access the technology services they need while ensuring value for money for taxpayers.
