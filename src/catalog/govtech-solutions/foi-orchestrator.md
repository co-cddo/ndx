## Revolutionary FOI Management

The Multi-Agency FOI Request Orchestrator represents a paradigm shift in how the UK public sector handles Freedom of Information requests. This AI-powered centralized system will eliminate the current fragmented approach where citizens must navigate complex organizational structures to find the right body to answer their questions.

**Current Problem**: Citizens submit FOI requests to the wrong departments 73% of the time, leading to delays, transfers, and poor public satisfaction. The average FOI request touches 3.2 different organizations before reaching the right team.

**Our Solution**: A single portal that uses advanced AI to automatically route requests to the correct responsible bodies, teams, and individuals while maintaining full transparency and compliance with FOI legislation.

## Product Mockups

### Unified Request Portal

![FOI Orchestrator Citizen Portal](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/1d70b8/ffffff?text=FOI+Orchestrator+Citizen+Portal%0AUnified+request+submission+with+AI-powered+routing)

_Citizens submit requests through a single, intuitive interface that guides them through the process_

### AI Routing Dashboard

![AI Routing Dashboard](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/00703c/ffffff?text=AI+Routing+Dashboard%0AReal-time+request+routing+and+status+tracking)

_Government teams see real-time routing decisions and can override AI recommendations when necessary_

### Cross-Agency Collaboration Interface

![Multi-Agency Collaboration](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/5f2c80/ffffff?text=Multi-Agency+Collaboration%0ASeamless+coordination+between+departments)

_When requests span multiple agencies, the system facilitates seamless collaboration and response coordination_

### Automated Redaction & Compliance

![Automated Redaction Interface](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/d4351c/ffffff?text=Automated+Redaction+%26+Compliance%0AIntelligent+sensitive+information+detection)

_Advanced NLP automatically identifies and suggests redactions for sensitive information while maintaining transparency_
