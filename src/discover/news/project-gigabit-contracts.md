The UK government has signed four new contracts worth over £289 million with Open reach as part of the ambitious Project Gigabit scheme. These contracts will significantly expand gigabit broadband access to areas including North and Southwest Wales, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Devon, Somerset, Essex, North East England, and Worcestershire.

This substantial investment represents another milestone in the government's £5 billion Project Gigabit initiative, which aims to accelerate the UK's economic recovery by boosting high-growth sectors such as technology and the creative industries. The program has already made considerable progress, with over £2.2 billion invested in contracts to deliver gigabit broadband upgrades across the country.

By expanding high-speed connectivity to previously underserved areas, the government is working to close the digital divide and ensure that communities throughout the UK can benefit from the opportunities offered by fast, reliable internet access. This investment in digital infrastructure will support innovation, productivity, and growth across multiple sectors of the economy.
