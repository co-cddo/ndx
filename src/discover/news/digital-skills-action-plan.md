The UK government has launched an ambitious Digital Inclusion Action Plan aimed at breaking down barriers to digital inclusion that currently affect approximately one in four Britons. The plan includes targeted funding for local initiatives focused on the most digitally-excluded groups, such as the elderly and low-income households.

A key component of the plan involves strategic partnerships with digital inclusion charities, including the Digital Poverty Alliance, to provide laptops and other essential devices to those in need. This initiative represents a significant step toward ensuring that everyone in the UK has the opportunity to benefit from digital services and technologies.

The Action Plan is expected to drive growth and create new opportunities by enabling more people to participate in the digital economy, supporting the government's broader commitment to enhancing digital skills across the nation.
