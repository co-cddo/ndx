---

## 1. Introduction

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) has undertaken a risk assessment of the SynapLyte™ platform, focusing on potential impacts on digital public services and the risk of AI-generated misinformation affecting public trust.

## 2. Risk Identification & Analysis

### 2.1. Risk: Digital Divide Amplification (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

**Description:** The deployment of advanced AI assistants like SynapLyte™ could inadvertently widen the digital divide, as citizens without digital skills or access may find government services increasingly AI-mediated and less accessible through traditional channels.
**Mitigation:** Maintain parallel non-AI service channels for all critical government services. Implement comprehensive digital inclusion training programs. Deploy simplified AI interfaces designed for users with limited digital literacy.

### 2.2. Risk: Over-reliance on AI-Generated Content (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)

**Description:** If government communications become predominantly AI-generated, there's a risk of losing authentic human voice in public messaging, potentially undermining trust and engagement with citizens.
**Mitigation:** Establish clear guidelines requiring human review and approval for all public-facing content. Implement AI disclosure requirements for transparency. Maintain a minimum 40% human-authored content ratio for key communications.

### 2.3. Risk: Public Confusion About AI Capabilities (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)

**Description:** The sophistication of SynapLyte™ may lead to public misconceptions about AI capabilities, causing either excessive trust or unwarranted fear about government AI use.
**Mitigation:** Develop a comprehensive public education campaign about AI in government. Create clear, accessible explanations of what SynapLyte™ can and cannot do. Establish a dedicated public inquiry service for AI-related concerns.

### 2.4. Risk: Misinterpretation of AI Confidence Scores (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Low)

**Description:** The platform's confidence scoring system, while useful for internal decision-making, might be misunderstood by the public if exposed in FOI responses or public reports.
**Mitigation:** Develop plain English explanations for all technical metrics. Include contextual guidance whenever AI-generated analysis is shared publicly. Train communications teams on interpreting and explaining AI outputs.

### 2.5. Risk: Unintended Bias in Public Service Delivery (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

**Description:** Despite bias mitigation efforts, AI-assisted decision-making might inadvertently disadvantage certain demographic groups, particularly in areas like benefit assessments or service prioritisation.
**Mitigation:** Implement mandatory equality impact assessments for all AI-assisted processes. Deploy continuous bias monitoring with monthly reporting. Establish citizen appeal processes for AI-influenced decisions.

## 3. Conclusion

DCMS deems the SynapLyte™ platform a valuable tool for digital transformation, provided the identified risks are actively managed. The potential for improved public service efficiency must be balanced with maintaining public trust and accessibility. Regular citizen feedback and transparent governance will be essential throughout deployment.
