The Local Digital Collaboration Unit is developing a comprehensive Cyber Health Framework designed to support councils in improving their cyber security posture. This innovative framework will provide local authorities with the tools and guidance needed to enhance their resilience against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, including malware and ransomware attacks.

A key component of the framework is the provision of technical remediation support, helping councils address vulnerabilities in their systems and networks. By taking a proactive approach to cyber security, the initiative aims to protect the integrity of critical local government systems and the sensitive data they contain.

The Cyber Health Framework represents an important investment in local government security infrastructure, ensuring that councils can continue to deliver essential services to their communities without disruption from cyber incidents. This initiative aligns with the government's broader strategy to strengthen cyber resilience across the public sector.
