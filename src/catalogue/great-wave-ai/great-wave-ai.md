Great Wave AI is the operating system for GenAI Agents in government. Our no-code platform empowers public sector organisations to build, deploy and manage networks of trusted GenAI agents without the need for specialist AI teams - bringing speed, safety, and control to your GenAI transformation.

### Who it's for

Great Wave AI is a good fit if your organisation meets any of the following:

- Is testing or scaling multiple GenAI use cases
- Is stuck at the “how do we go live?” stage
- Prioritises governance, compliance, and performance
- Needs data in existing environments - cloud, private or air-gapped deployment options
- Wants to empower the business teams to own their GenAI agents

## Business benefits

Automate repetitive admin and free up your teams for higher-value work.

### Accelerate decision-making

Empower teams with real-time insights, summaries and next-best actions drawn from complex, unstructured data.

### Enhance citizen and customer services

Build agents that provide accurate, always-on responses across channels - improving user experience and reducing call volumes.

### Strengthen compliance and oversight

Ensure secure, traceable and auditable GenAI workflows that reduce risk and demonstrate control.
