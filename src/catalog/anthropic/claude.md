Claude is an advanced AI assistant developed by Anthropic, designed to make complex tasks simpler through natural, helpful interactions. It excels at text analysis, content creation, programming assistance, and data extraction—all while prioritising safety, accuracy, and ethical use.

The UK government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Anthropic to explore how Claude can enhance public services, establishing best practices for the responsible deployment of frontier AI capabilities in the public sector and improving citizens' access to government information and services.

Start enhancing your public services with Claude today. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Sign up for an Anthropic account or sign in to your existing account
2. Choose the appropriate Claude model for your needs (Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku)
3. Configure secure access with UK government identity systems
4. Set up appropriate usage policies and guardrails
5. Begin integrating Claude into your workflows and applications

Claude supports users across technical and non-technical domains:

- **User-friendly chat interface** allows policy experts, administrators, and frontline staff to access Claude's capabilities without requiring technical knowledge.

- **Developer-oriented API ecosystem** enables technical teams to integrate Claude's capabilities into existing systems, applications, and workflows.

### Choose the right model for your use case

Claude offers three models with different capabilities to suit various needs:

- **Claude 3 Opus**: The most powerful model, ideal for complex reasoning, in-depth analysis, and handling sensitive tasks that require nuanced understanding.

- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: A balanced model offering strong performance and faster response times, perfect for day-to-day tasks and most government applications.

- **Claude 3 Haiku**: The fastest and most cost-effective model, excellent for straightforward tasks and high-volume applications.

### Ensure compliance with UK data protection standards

Claude is designed with privacy and security at its core, supporting data residency within the UK to help government organisations meet their regulatory requirements. Anthropic implements privacy by design principles and provides tools for managing data subject access requests and consent, ensuring compliance with UK GDPR and other relevant regulations.

### Improve services through responsible AI implementation

Claude has been built following Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach, which emphasises safety, reliability, and ethical AI use. This makes it well-suited for sensitive government applications where maintaining public trust is paramount, with built-in safeguards against harmful outputs, bias, and misuse.

## Business Needs

### Enhance Citizen Services

Improve service delivery by developing AI-powered assistants that can answer citizen queries accurately, translate complex policy documents into plain English, and provide 24/7 support across multiple channels.

### Accelerate Document Processing

Reduce backlogs and processing times by automating the analysis of complex documents, extracting key information from forms, and generating consistent summaries of lengthy reports and submissions.

### Digital Inclusion Support

Create more accessible government services by transforming complex documents into easier-to-understand formats with larger fonts, increased spacing, and supporting images—similar to Swindon Borough Council's 'Simply Readable' tool powered by Claude.

### Policy Analysis and Development

Strengthen policy development by analysing large volumes of research, stakeholder feedback, and previous policies to identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for improvement.

### Cross-department Knowledge Management

Improve knowledge sharing across government departments by making archives and document repositories more easily searchable and extracting insights from previously siloed information.

### Staff Productivity Enhancement

Support civil servants with drafting correspondence, preparing briefings, code development, and other routine tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities that require human judgment and expertise.
