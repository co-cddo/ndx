Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides highly available, fully managed OpenShift clusters on demand, monitored and operated jointly by Microsoft and Red Hat. Kubernetes is at the core of Red Hat OpenShift. OpenShift brings added-value features to complement Kubernetes, making it a turnkey container platform as a service (PaaS) with a significantly improved developer and operator experience.

- Highly available, fully managed public and private clusters, automated operations, and over-the-air platform upgrades.
- Built on top of upstream Kubernetes and bundled with key capabilities for unified operations as a complete platform.
- Joint engineering, operation, and support from Microsoft and Red Hat, with multiple compliance certifications.

### Focus on what matters

Take advantage of the enhanced user interface for application topology and builds in the web console to build, deploy, configure, and visualize containerized applications and cluster resources more easily.

### Provision self-service, on-demand application stacks

Bring your code from a Git repository or an existing container image and build it using source-to-image (S2I) builds, or deploy solutions from the Developer Catalogue such as OpenShift Service Mesh, OpenShift Serverless, or Knative.

### Use built-in CI/CD

Automate build, test, and deployment of applications using OpenShift Pipelines, a serverless continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) system designed to scale, create a pipeline using GitHub Actions, or bring your own.

### Rapid cloud development experience

Use Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, a collaborative, fully containerized web IDE that runs on top of OpenShift, for a consistent, more secure, zero-configuration cloud application development experience.

## Business Needs

### Scalable Digital Services

Deploy and manage citizen-facing applications more quickly by giving development teams a secure, fully managed platform that works across cloud and on-premises environments. Azure Red Hat OpenShift helps reduce time to launch by providing built-in automation, security features, and consistent development tools.

### Flexible AI and Data Workloads

Support AI and data initiatives with a platform that can run complex models, manage large datasets, and scale flexibly. Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows organisations to deploy AI assistants, natural language tools, and analytics pipelines while maintaining governance and operational control.

### Hybrid Cloud Consistency

Run applications reliably across environments without the risk of lock-in. With Azure Red Hat OpenShift, teams can develop once and deploy anywhere - whether in a secure data centre or the public cloud - ensuring service continuity and alignment with architectural standards.

### Secure Modernisation

Modernise legacy applications and infrastructure with a platform designed for security and compliance. Azure Red Hat OpenShift includes role-based access control, automated patching, and built-in monitoring to support secure, resilient operations from day one.

### Developer Productivity and Automation

Increase development speed by streamlining common tasks with integrated automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code. Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows teams to focus on building services, not managing environments, by embedding DevSecOps practices into everyday workflows.

### Cost-Efficient Platform Operations

Improve efficiency by consolidating applications onto a shared platform with built-in autoscaling, usage-based billing, and resource controls. Azure Red Hat OpenShift helps optimise cloud spend while enabling teams to deliver more with fewer operational overheads, leveraging Microsoft Site Reliability Engineering expertise.
