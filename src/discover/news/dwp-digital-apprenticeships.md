The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Digital has celebrated the success of its apprenticeship program during National Apprenticeship Week, highlighting the positive impact of its Learning at Work Week activities. The initiative has been instrumental in developing digital talent within the department and addressing skills gaps in the civil service.

DWP Digital's apprenticeship program offers participants hands-on experience in various digital roles, providing them with valuable skills and career development opportunities. The program has created pathways for individuals from diverse backgrounds to enter digital careers in the public sector, contributing to the government's broader agenda of building digital capability.

The success of the DWP's apprenticeship model demonstrates how government departments can effectively nurture talent and build the skills needed for digital transformation. By investing in apprenticeships, DWP is not only developing its workforce but also contributing to the wider goal of increasing digital skills across the UK public sector.
