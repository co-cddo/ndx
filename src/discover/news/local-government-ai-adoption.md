Hillingdon Council has become the first UK local authority to implement voice automation and AI at scale, successfully developing an AI-driven citizen contact system that has delivered impressive operational improvements. The innovative system has reduced the cost per call by 5% and effectively provided the capacity equivalent to 25-30 full-time employees.

This pioneering implementation demonstrates how AI can be effectively deployed in local government to enhance service delivery while improving efficiency. The council's approach serves as a valuable model for other local authorities looking to harness the power of AI and automation to better serve their communities.

The success of Hillingdon's AI initiative aligns with the government's broader strategy to accelerate digital transformation across the public sector, highlighting the potential of emerging technologies to transform local government services and create better outcomes for citizens.
