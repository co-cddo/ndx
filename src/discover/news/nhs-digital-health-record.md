The NHS has announced plans to develop a comprehensive Digital Health Record (DHR) system to drive improvements in health and care services, ensuring the healthcare system is ready for the artificial intelligence era. This ambitious initiative aims to deliver precision public health by offering tailored advice, investigations, and early treatment based on individual risk factors.

The DHR proposal represents a significant step forward in the NHS's digital transformation journey, integrating patient data to enable more personalized and effective healthcare delivery. The system is designed to improve health outcomes while enhancing operational efficiency across the healthcare system.

In parallel with the DHR development, the NHS is actively trialing AI technologies at various levels of the health system, from guiding health policy to improving operational efficiency in hospitals and primary care. These innovations are expected to support the development and adoption of AI technologies, enhancing productivity and patient care throughout the NHS.
