# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

# ============================================================
# REGRESSION FIX SUMMARY (2025-11-24)
# ============================================================
# Problem: govukEleventyPlugin header template overriding custom header
# - Custom header at src/_includes/components/header/template.njk NOT being used
# - Built HTML had NO #auth-nav element
# - Try page <main> content was empty (no #try-sessions-container)
#
# Solution Applied:
# 1. Added #auth-nav via serviceNavigation.slots.end in eleventy.config.js
# 2. Created custom try-page.njk layout for Try page content
# 3. Updated auth-nav.ts to use govuk-service-navigation__link class
# 4. Updated src/try/index.md to use the custom layout
#
# Files Modified:
# - eleventy.config.js (line 114-116): Added slots.end with auth-nav span
# - src/_includes/layouts/try-page.njk (NEW): Custom layout for try page
# - src/try/index.md: Changed layout to layouts/try-page.njk
# - src/try/ui/auth-nav.ts: Updated CSS classes for service navigation
#
# Test Results After Fix:
# - E2E Auth Tests: 22/24 passing (2 redirect timeout flakes)
# - #auth-nav element present in all pages
# - #try-sessions-container renders correctly on /try page
# ============================================================
