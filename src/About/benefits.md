The National Digital Exchange (NDX), offers several potential benefits for both the UK public and private sectors.

## Public sector benefits

- **Reduced activation time for cloud services:** The current 6 to 9 month activation time for cloud services poses a significant barrier to efficient cloud adoption within government departments. NDX aims to reduce this activation time by offering pre-configured, secure cloud environments that can be rapidly deployed.
- **Increased consistency and security of cloud environments:** The absence of a standardised approach to cloud adoption has led to a fragmented landscape of inconsistent cloud environments across different departments, raising security risks and creating inefficiencies. NDX will offer standardised, secure cloud environments that comply with best practices, reducing these risks and promoting interoperability.
- **Improved access to cloud resources for all departments:** Smaller departments or those with limited technical expertise currently struggle to access and use advanced cloud capabilities, resulting in a digital divide within government. NDX will level the playing field by providing equitable access to cloud resources for all departments, regardless of their size or technical expertise.
- **Cost optimisation and better deals with cloud vendors:** The decentralised nature of cloud adoption has resulted in varied vendor relationships, complicating negotiations and potentially leading to cost inefficiencies for government. NDX will streamline vendor interactions and use the collective bargaining power of government to negotiate better deals and cost savings for all departments.
- **Enhanced sharing and collaboration:** By offering a platform for sharing data, APIs, and best practices, NDX will foster collaboration and knowledge sharing between government departments. This will reduce duplication of effort and promote innovation across the public sector.
- **Elevated standards of digital service delivery:** The National Digital Code, incorporating technical best practices and a code of conduct for public servants, will promote high standards of digital service delivery across government. This will enhance trust and confidence in public services.

## Private sector benefits

- **Access to government data and services:** NDX will provide entrepreneurs and innovators with secure and authenticated access to government data and services through APIs. This will unlock opportunities for developing new products and services.
- **Streamlined access to the public sector market:** NDX will offer a platform for businesses, including UK SMEs and tech startups, to reach the public sector market more easily. Pre-arranged commercial agreements and standardised processes will reduce barriers to entry and encourage innovation.
- **Clear standards for responsible digital citizenship:** The National Digital Code will establish clear standards for responsible and ethical digital behaviour, setting a benchmark for businesses to follow. This will enhance trust and confidence in the UK as a digital marketplace.
