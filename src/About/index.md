It will build on existing initiatives such as the data marketplace, the National Data Library, and the Cloud Marketplace. NDX combines several technologies and platforms, including an API gateway, an event bus, a data streaming service, Reddit, StackOverflow, and GitHub.

## The innovation pipeline

NDX creates a complete innovation ecosystem that connects government challenges to practical solutions through a structured pipeline:

1. **[Challenges](/challenges/)** - Government departments publish problem statements that identify specific operational needs, inefficiencies, or capability gaps requiring innovative solutions
2. **Campaigns** - Industry and academia create kickstarter-style pre-commitment products that address these challenges, requiring buy-in from multiple organisations before development begins
3. **[Catalogue](/catalogue/)** - Successfully funded campaigns become deployed solutions available for immediate procurement and use across government
4. **[Reviews](/reviews/)** - Users provide feedback and assessments on deployed solutions, creating a feedback loop that improves future procurement decisions

This pipeline ensures that innovation is driven by real government needs, solutions are validated before development, and successful products become widely available across the public sector. It transforms traditional procurement from reactive purchasing to proactive problem-solving through collaborative innovation.

By enabling the sharing of data and resources, the NDX aims to address the challenge of siloed working within the public sector. It is hoped that this will foster collaboration and prevent duplication of effort.

### NDX objectives

- Provide **standardised and secure cloud environments** to reduce activation time and costs for departments.
- Offer a **marketplace for pre-approved cloud services** to simplify the procurement process and ensure compliance with government standards.
- Establish a **community platform** for knowledge sharing and collaboration among digital data professionals.
- Provide **access to high-value datasets and APIs** to encourage data sharing and collaboration between departments.

The hope is that by simplifying the process of accessing and utilising cloud services, the NDX will accelerate cloud adoption across the UK public sector and address issues such as prolonged activation times and inconsistent cloud environments.
