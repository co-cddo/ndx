Cloudflare Zero Trust is a comprehensive security platform that helps UK public sector organisations protect their resources, applications, data, and users from cyber threats. It replaces traditional perimeter-based security models with identity-based security controls that work anywhere your users are located.

While traditional security approaches rely on VPNs, hardware firewalls, and complex network configurations, Cloudflare Zero Trust provides a cloud-native solution that is faster to deploy, easier to manage, and more secure by default—without compromising user experience.

Start securing your public sector resources with Cloudflare Zero Trust today. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Sign up for a Cloudflare account or sign in to your existing account
2. Navigate to the Zero Trust dashboard
3. Configure your identity providers (supports integration with UK government identity systems)
4. Define access policies for your applications and resources
5. Deploy the WARP client to user devices or configure browser isolation

Cloudflare Zero Trust supports both business and technical users:

- An **intuitive policy builder** allows security teams to create and enforce access policies without complex coding or configuration, making it accessible to non-technical administrators.

- The **comprehensive API ecosystem** provides developers with programmatic control over all Zero Trust services, enabling custom integrations and automation workflows.

### Simplify security with a single control plane

Cloudflare Zero Trust unifies multiple security capabilities into a single platform, eliminating the need to manage disparate point solutions. The platform includes ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access), SWG (Secure Web Gateway), CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker), DLP (Data Loss Prevention), and Browser Isolation—all managed through a single dashboard.

### Meet UK government security standards with certified services

Cloudflare is Cyber Essentials certified, which means it meets the UK government-backed scheme designed to help organisations protect themselves against common cyber threats. Cloudflare Zero Trust aligns with National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidelines for robust identity verification and authorisation, making it suitable for handling sensitive government data while supporting compliance with UK data protection regulations.

### Enhance performance while strengthening security

Unlike traditional security solutions that add latency and degrade user experience, Cloudflare Zero Trust is built on a global network with data centers in over 300 cities, including multiple locations across the UK. This architecture ensures that security checks happen close to your users, providing both robust protection and exceptional performance for UK public sector services.

## Business Needs

### Remote Work Security

Enable secure access to internal applications for civil servants and contractors working from anywhere, without the performance issues and security risks of traditional VPNs, supporting the UK Government's Smarter Working initiative.

### Legacy Application Modernisation

Extend Zero Trust security to legacy applications without code changes, allowing UK government agencies to maintain security for critical systems while modernising at their own pace in line with the Government Digital Service (GDS) guidelines.

### Insider Threat Mitigation

Reduce the risk of data breaches from insider threats by applying granular access controls, monitoring user activity, and enforcing least-privilege access to sensitive systems as recommended by the NCSC.

### Third-Party Access Management

Securely connect contractors, partners, and other third parties to specific resources without granting broad network access, reducing your attack surface and supporting supply chain security requirements.

### Cross-Department Collaboration

Maintain consistent security policies when collaborating across different UK government departments and agencies, ensuring secure information sharing while preserving appropriate access controls.

### GDPR Compliance Support

Help meet GDPR requirements with comprehensive visibility into data access, tools to implement appropriate security measures, and capabilities to detect and respond to data incidents promptly.
