title: "UnicornCount™: Economic Viability & Aura-Adjusted Cost-Benefit Analysis"
---

## 1. Overview

Her Majesty's Treasury of Esoteric Economies (HMTEE) has performed due diligence on the UnicornCount™ platform to ascertain its economic viability for widespread public sector adoption. This includes an Aura-Adjusted Cost-Benefit Analysis (AACBA) to account for previously unquantifiable metaphysical impacts.

## 2. Financial Scrutiny

### 2.1. Subscription Model Analysis

The tiered subscription model (Bronze, Silver, Gold) appears straightforward. However, the "Gold" tier's "dedicated support from cryptozoology experts" lacks clearly defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for resolving issues such as rogue pixie infestations in server farms or spontaneous glitter materialization.
**Recommendation:** Request clarification on expert support SLAs, specifically regarding response times for Class 2 or higher thaumaturgical incidents.

### 2.2. Aura-Adjusted Cost-Benefit Analysis (AACBA)

Standard CBA models are insufficient for products interacting with the arcane. Our AACBA incorporates:

- **Positive Aura Value (PAV):** Increased national morale due to confirmed unicorn presence (£1.2M PAV estimated annually).
- **Glitter Abatement Cost (GAC):** Cost of specialized cleaning services for government buildings experiencing spontaneous glitter materialization (£50k GAC estimated annually per 100 active dashboards).
- **Productivity Fluctuation Index (PFI):** Measures minor productivity dips due to staff daydreaming about unicorns, offset by boosts from enhanced departmental prestige (Net -£15k PFI estimated).

Initial AACBA indicates a net positive economic impact, primarily driven by the high PAV. However, GAC could escalate if the glitter side-effect is not contained.

## 3. Market Positioning & Long-Term Viability

### 3.1. Competitive Landscape

UnicornCount™ currently holds a monopoly in automated unicorn detection. However, intelligence suggests rival Gnomish startups are developing truffle-based unicorn tracking systems. While technologically inferior, these may offer lower price points.
**Recommendation:** Advise Mythical™ to invest in R&D to maintain their technological lead and consider a budget-friendly "Pony Club Plus" tier.

### 3.2. Risk of Obsolescence due to Prophecy

A review of major prophecies (Nostradamus, Old Mother Shipton, Dept. of Premonitions archives) indicates no immediate large-scale unicorn-related events that would render the platform obsolete (e.g., "The Great Unicorn Departure" or "The Return of the Pegasi"). Risk assessed as low for the next 5-7 fiscal years.

## 4. Conclusion

HMTEE finds UnicornCount™ to be an economically sound investment for the public sector, subject to clarification on support SLAs and ongoing monitoring of the GAC. Its current market dominance and low prophecy-obsolescence risk are favorable.
