The UK government is taking significant steps to strengthen cyber and technical resilience across the public sector, implementing a range of measures to protect critical systems and sensitive data. This comprehensive approach includes expanding GOV.UK One Login and other common components to enhance security while improving user experience.

A key aspect of the strategy involves enabling more secure access to data through the National Data Library, ensuring that information can be shared and utilized effectively while maintaining appropriate protections. The government is also focused on building more responsibly, incorporating security considerations throughout the development and deployment of digital services.

These cybersecurity improvements are essential for protecting public sector systems from increasingly sophisticated threats and maintaining public trust in government digital services. By investing in stronger cybersecurity infrastructure and practices, the government is working to ensure the integrity and availability of critical systems that support essential public services, while safeguarding the personal data of citizens.
